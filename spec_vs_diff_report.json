  "summary": "All seven requirements are substantially implemented in the diff. REQ-1 through REQ-7 each have corresponding new components, hooks, and CSS. Minor observation: the LandingPageNav does not include a 'Pricing' anchor section link, which the spec explicitly calls out as an expected nav target. Overall implementation is thorough and well-aligned with the spec.",
