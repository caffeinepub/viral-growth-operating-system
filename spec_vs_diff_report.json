  "summary": "The diff adds a <meta name=\"ic-canister-id\" content=\"xzgjg-tiaaa-aaaal-qndgq-cai\" /> tag to frontend/index.html, which partially addresses REQ-1 by embedding the canister ID in the HTML entry point. However, REQ-2 requires changes to dfx.json or equivalent deployment configuration to declare the frontend asset canister with the correct canister ID binding for mainnet — no such file was modified in the diff. The project_state.json also shows both AR-1 and AR-2 as still pending, confirming neither requirement is fully implemented.",
