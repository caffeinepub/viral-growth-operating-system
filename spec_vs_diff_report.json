  "summary": "The diff shows modifications to backend/main.mo, frontend-file-summaries.txt, frontend/index.html, and project_state.json. The critical requirement REQ-1 (adding a <meta name='dfinity-canister-id'> tag to frontend/index.html) is NOT implemented — the index.html shown in the diff contains no such meta tag. REQ-2 (updating backend canister ID in actor configuration/declarations) and REQ-3 (auditing/fixing dfx.json canister IDs and network targets) are also not implemented, as no changes to dfx.json, canister declarations, or useActor.ts are present in the diff. All three requirements remain in 'pending' status per project_state.json. The only substantive code change is to backend/main.mo, which is unrelated to the deployment configuration fix requested.",
