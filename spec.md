# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Enhance the Viral Growth OS landing page with animations, interactive elements, and new sections to improve visual appeal and conversions.

**Planned changes:**
- Add scroll-triggered fade-in and slide-up animations to cards, sections, and list items throughout the app
- Add hover effects to interactive cards and navigation links
- Add pulse/ripple click animations to all primary CTA buttons (e.g., "Get Started", "Generate Content", "Upgrade")
- Add a bold hero section at the top of the LandingPage with headline, subheadline, and a CTA button linking to pricing/sign-up
- Add a testimonials section to the LandingPage with at least 3 fictional customer quote cards (name, role, quote)
- Add a countdown timer to the LandingPage counting down to a promotional deadline, showing days/hours/minutes/seconds with a fallback message at zero
- Add an image carousel to the LandingPage with at least 3 slides, auto-advance every 4–5 seconds, prev/next arrows, and dot indicators
- Implement smooth scroll navigation on the LandingPage with anchor links in the header scrolling to Features, How It Works, Pricing, and Testimonials sections, with active section highlighting
- All animations respect the `prefers-reduced-motion` accessibility setting

**User-visible outcome:** Visitors to the landing page experience a polished, animated page with a hero banner, countdown timer, feature carousel, testimonials, and smooth anchor navigation, while all interactive buttons provide visual feedback on click.
